# 🎬 SOP Video Recording Instructions

> **Purpose:** Create training videos that teach new team members from 0-90% knowledge by just watching.

---

## 📋 General Video Best Practices (Apply to ALL SOPs)

### ✅ DO's
- **Be conversational** — Talk like you're explaining to a friend, not reading a script
- **Use your own words** — 80% should be YOUR understanding of the principles
- **Show real examples** — Open actual stores, tools, or screens to demonstrate
- **Add 1-2 line personal insights** — "From my experience..." or "What I've learned is..."
- **Use simple language** — Explain like teaching a 5-year-old who knows nothing
- **Pause and emphasize** — Slow down on critical points
- **Give context** — Explain WHY things matter, not just WHAT to do

### ❌ DON'Ts
- Don't read the SOP word-for-word (robotic)
- Don't rush through sections
- Don't assume prior knowledge
- Don't skip examples
- Don't forget to show the actual tools/screens

### 🎥 Video Format
- **Length:** 15-30 minutes per SOP (split into parts if longer)
- **Tool:** Loom (screen + face recording)
- **Resolution:** 1080p minimum
- **Audio:** Clear, no background noise
- **Screen:** Show SOP document + live demos side by side
