        { q: "An employee sends you a spreadsheet showing their salary is 20% below market. They're right. What do you do?", o: ["Ignore it — they signed the contract", "Promise to look into it (and forget)", "Acknowledge it, discuss with leadership, and fix it if possible", "Tell them to accept it or leave"], c: 2 },
        { q: "A candidate says 'my last company was terrible, management was clueless, and my teammates were lazy.' This is:", o: ["Honest feedback — they're transparent", "A red flag — they blame others instead of owning their role", "Neutral — everyone has bad experiences", "A green flag — they have high standards"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Someone asks 'What does HR actually DO here?' The correct answer is:", o: ["We process paperwork and payroll", "We're the company police making sure rules are followed", "We're a strategic growth engine — finding and retaining top talent", "We plan parties and events"], c: 2 },
