        title: "👋 WELCOME TO DIGITAL HEROES",
        content: `You're now part of something bigger than a job.

**WHO WE ARE:**
→ Founded: 2020 by the team that built Digital Heroes
→ 2.5M+ YouTube subscribers (Digital Marketing Heroes)
→ Shopify-exclusive agency on Fiverr
→ Built and sold ecommerce brands (₹2.1+ crore exits)
→ Team: 8-10 people (hybrid work model)

**WHAT WE DO:**
We don't just build Shopify stores. We build conversion machines that make our clients money.

**WHERE WE'RE GOING:**

Our mission is simple: Become the best online service agency in the world.

→ 2026: Top 100 digital agency globally
→ 2027: Known worldwide for exceptional Shopify stores
→ 2028: The gold standard for ecommerce excellence

We're not chasing revenue numbers. We're chasing MASTERY.

When clients think "world-class Shopify store," they should think of us first. When other agencies look for inspiration, they should study our work. When entrepreneurs need transformation, they should trust us completely.

Excellence is the goal. Revenue is just the scorecard.

You're joining us on this journey. Your success = Our success.`
    },
    {
        title: "⚡ WHAT WE EXPECT FROM YOU",
        content: `This isn't a typical company. We have high standards because we're building something exceptional.

**DISCIPLINE IS YOUR GREATEST INVESTMENT**

Nobody will watch you work. You watch yourself.

Discipline = Doing the work even when you don't feel like it.

That moment when your body says "rest" but your mind says "execute"? That's when you're building who you really are. Every time you choose discipline, you win. Not for us. For YOU.

**TALENT IS IRRELEVANT. VOLUME IS EVERYTHING.**

Think you lack skills? Good—now you know what to do.

→ Put in 100 hours learning
→ Analyze your progress
→ Need more? Put in 500 hours

The people you admire didn't start with talent—they started with commitment.

We don't care about your degree. We care about your OUTPUT.

VOLUME BUILDS MASTERY. YOU CONTROL THE PACE.`
    },
    {
        title: "💬 EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE & WORK ETHIC",
        content: `**EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE > IQ**

People with high EQ don't just perform better—they LIVE better.

→ They build real relationships
→ They influence outcomes
→ They lead
→ They're respected

Check yourself:
→ How do you respond under pressure?
→ How do you treat people when frustrated?
→ How emotionally intelligent are you?

Master this, and everything else gets easier.

**ALWAYS FIND MORE MEANINGFUL WORK**

Never wait for approval. Always think:
→ "How can I do this better?"
→ "What else needs to be done?"
→ "How can I add more value?"

We don't promote based on time served. We promote based on VALUE CREATED.

Waiting is wasting your time. Never kill time. Always do something that builds your skills.

**INSTANT REPLY = RESPECT**

When you respond quickly to teammates, clients, and management, you're showing CHARACTER.

You're saying:
→ "I respect you"
→ "I'm reliable"
→ "I care about this"

This isn't about surveillance. It's about you deciding to be someone people TRUST.`
    },
    {
        title: "🧠 MINDSET & PRIORITIES",
        content: `**PROTECT YOUR MINDSET**

Stop thinking negative thoughts about yourself, the team, or the work.

If you catch yourself thinking negatively:
→ Figure out what causes it
→ Kill those habits
→ Change your environment
→ Build character that helps your growth

Your mindset is your responsibility. Guard it fiercely.

**CLIENTS AREN'T A BURDEN—THEY'RE YOUR OPPORTUNITY**

When a client succeeds, it's because of YOU.
When they fail, you feel it.

That responsibility is a gift. It means your work MATTERS.

Approach every client like you're personally invested in their success. Because you should be. That's not servitude—that's PRIDE in your craft.

**WORK = HIGHEST PRIORITY**

There is nothing better in life than meaningful work.

When your actions help someone, you feel satisfied automatically. You must help your clients with ALL your heart.

These clients will help others with their products/services. You're a contributor in this beautiful cycle.

Real satisfaction comes from BUILDING something that matters.

**80/20 PRINCIPLE**

→ 80% of your time: Productive work that builds skill and delivers results
→ 20% of your time: Everything else (breaks, rest, fun)

Monitor yourself. Track your activities. Know where every hour goes.`

        title: "🚨 CRITICAL RULES - IMMEDIATE TERMINATION",
        content: `These aren't negotiable. There are no warnings. No second chances.

Why? Because we serve global clients. Our reputation depends on reliability.

**CLIENT DATA BREACH = TERMINATION + LEGAL ACTION**
