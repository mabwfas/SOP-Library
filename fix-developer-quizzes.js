First action:", o: ["Email the team about the issue", "Check Shopify Status page → if Shopify is up, check recent changes → rollback last deployment immediately", "Wait 5 minutes to see if it resolves", "Contact Shopify support and wait for response"], c: 1 },
    { q: "Critical bug in production: The 'Add to Cart' button doesn't work. Timeline to fix:", o: ["Next business day — it's after hours", "IMMEDIATELY — every minute this is broken, real revenue is lost, treat as P0 emergency", "Within 4 hours — standard SLA", "When the developer is available"], c: 1 },

    { q: "Post-incident review (postmortem) matters because:", o: ["Management requires documentation", "Understanding root cause prevents recurrence — without learning from failures, you fight the same fires repeatedly", "It assigns blame to prevent future mistakes", "It's an optional step for minor incidents"], c: 1 },
    { q: "Communication during a crisis: The client messages 'WHY IS MY STORE DOWN?' You respond:", o: ["'I'm working on it' (no details)", "'We've identified the issue: [brief cause].

    { q: "SSL certificate error 'Your connection is not private' — impact:", o: ["Minor — users can click 'proceed anyway'", "Most users leave immediately — SSL errors signal 'this site is dangerous' and browsers discourage staying", "Affects SEO rankings but not user behavior", "A concern for payment pages but not product pages"], c: 1 },
    { q: "Multiple developers working on the same theme without Git:", o: ["Works fine if they communicate via Slack", "A recipe for overwritten code, lost changes, and deployment conflicts — Git is mandatory for team development", "Shopify Online Editor handles version control", "Acceptable for small teams of 2-3 developers"], c: 1 },
    { q: "The crisis management communication rule for developers is:", o: ["Don't communicate until you have a solution", "Over-communicate — stakeholders fear uncertainty more than bad news, regular updates reduce anxiety during incidents", "Route all communication through the PM", "Send one update when the crisis is resolved"], c: 1 }

    { q: "AI-generated Liquid: {% for product in collections.all.products %} without pagination will:", o: ["Work perfectly for all collection sizes", "Crash on large catalogs — AI often generates technically valid but practically dangerous code ignoring Shopify limits", "Be caught automatically by Shopify's error handler", "Fail on stores with 10,000+ products but work otherwise"], c: 1 },
    { q: "AI for SEO: Generating meta descriptions with AI helps:", o: ["Nothing — search engines penalize AI-generated content", "Scale meta description creation for large catalogs — unique descriptions for 500 products would take days manually", "Create perfect descriptions that need no editing", "Replace the need for understanding SEO fundamentals"], c: 1 },
    { q: "Using AI to generate test cases for QA:", o: ["Automated tests should all be written manually", "AI can suggest edge cases you might miss — 'what if variant is out of stock AND has a discount?' type scenarios", "AI-generated tests are always comprehensive enough", "Testing should remain an entirely manual process"], c: 1 },
    { q: "AI-powered image optimization tools help developers by:", o: ["Replacing Shopify's image CDN entirely", "Automating format conversion (WebP), compression, and responsive sizing — tedious tasks saving hours on large sites", "Creating original product images from text descriptions", "Generating alt text that replaces manual SEO work"], c: 1 },

    { q: "AI code review before human review:", o: ["Adds unnecessary overhead to the development process", "Catches syntax errors, security issues, and common mistakes before human reviewers — saving review cycles", "Replaces the need for human code review entirely", "Works well for simple changes but misses complex issues"], c: 1 },
    { q: "The AI-augmented developer's career advantage is:", o: ["Faster typing speed through AI autocomplete", "Leveraging AI for repetitive tasks while applying human judgment for architecture, UX, and business decisions", "Knowing more AI tools than other developers", "Being able to write code without understanding the fundamentals"], c: 1 }

    { q: "A Shopify expert's code review reveals 4 accessibility violations in your theme. This means:", o: ["Accessibility has minimal impact on e-commerce stores", "Fix them — accessibility failures mean 15-20% of users can't fully use the store, impacting both ethics and revenue", "These are minor issues to address in the next sprint", "Government websites need this, but e-commerce stores don't"], c: 1 },
    { q: "Career growth: Specializing in Shopify speed optimization is valuable because:", o: ["Speed is a niche concern with limited demand", "Every Shopify store needs it — performance specialists command premium rates because speed directly impacts revenue", "Enterprise stores are the only ones that care about load times", "Speed optimization will be fully automated by AI within 2 years"], c: 1 },

    { q: "Continuous learning in Shopify development matters because:", o: ["The platform rarely introduces breaking changes", "Shopify ships updates weekly — developers who stop learning get left behind as the platform evolves rapidly", "Documentation and tutorials cover everything needed", "Learning plateaus after 3 years of experience"], c: 1 },
    { q: "Portfolio projects for a Shopify developer should showcase:", o: ["As many projects as possible regardless of quality", "Quality over quantity — 3 well-documented stores with performance metrics beat 20 screenshots without context", "Enterprise-level clients exclusively for credibility", "Projects using the most complex features available"], c: 1 },
    { q: "Contributing to the Shopify community (forums, open-source, blog posts) helps:", o: ["Other developers, but not your own career", "Build reputation, attract clients, and deepen your own understanding — teaching forces mastery", "Nothing directly for career growth or income", "Self-employed developers, but not those working at agencies"], c: 1 },
    { q: "The Zero Tolerance for Bugs principle from Task 2, applied across your career:", o: ["Means never shipping anything until it's 100% perfect", "Builds a reputation for reliability — clients pay premium for developers whose code doesn't break in production", "Creates overly cautious and slow developers", "Means catching bugs that customers report as a priority"], c: 1 },
    { q: "The interconnected chain from Task 2 means a developer:", o: ["Works independently from other departments", "Is connected to design, marketing, sales, and customer success — code changes ripple through the entire business", "Communicates through the PM as the single point of contact", "Should focus exclusively on code quality and nothing else"], c: 1 },
    { q: "Speed is Revenue (Task 2) combined with Speed Optimization (Task 7):", o: ["Creates redundant overlapping learning content", "Produces a developer who instinctively writes performant code AND can audit existing stores — double value", "Is theoretical knowledge that rarely applies in practice", "Is important but secondary to feature delivery speed"], c: 1 },

    { q: "QA + Troubleshooting + Crisis Management together represent:", o: ["Three separate unrelated skills that happen to be in the same training", "The complete reliability stack — prevent issues, solve issues, manage fallout when issues arise", "Overlapping content that should have been consolidated into one module", "Skills that are delegated to DevOps teams in real organizations"], c: 1 },

    { q: "What percentage of Shopify's total GMV comes from custom/modified themes?", o: ["Less than 10% — most merchants use default themes", "The majority — merchants invest in customization because template stores don't differentiate or convert as well", "Approximately 50% — evenly split between custom and default", "Nearly none — default themes satisfy most merchant needs"], c: 1 },
    { q: "Your role as a Shopify developer in the organization is:", o: ["An isolated technical contributor building what is requested", "The engine that turns design and strategy into revenue-generating stores — the intersection of code and commerce", "A support function that assists designers with implementation", "Interchangeable with any web developer regardless of platform experience"], c: 1 },
