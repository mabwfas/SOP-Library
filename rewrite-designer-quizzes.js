    task12Quiz: [
        { q: "Client says 'I don't like the design' with no specifics. Your response:", o: ["'You approved the brief, so this is what you get'", "Ask specific questions: 'What specifically isn't working — the colors, layout, or style? Let me show you alternatives.'", "'I'll start over from scratch'", "'Design is subjective — this is objectively good'"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A client demands 20 revision rounds for a project scoped for 3. You should:", o: ["Do all 20 revisions to keep them happy", "Reference the scope agreement, offer consolidated feedback rounds, and quote additional revisions — boundaries protect your work", "Refuse any additional revisions", "Escalate to management immediately"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Receiving harsh feedback 'This looks amateur' — the professional response:", o: ["Take it personally and defend your work", "Stay calm, ask for specific examples, understand their vision, and propose targeted improvements — ego kills careers", "Agree and start over completely", "Ignore the feedback and deliver as-is"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A developer says your design is 'impossible to build.' You should:", o: ["Insist your design must be followed exactly", "Understand the technical constraints, collaborate on a feasible alternative that maintains design intent — design and dev are partners", "Simplify the entire design to be safe", "Tell the PM to handle it"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Client wants a design that EXACTLY copies a competitor store. The ethical response:", o: ["Copy it exactly — client is paying", "Explain legal/brand risks, then propose: 'Let me design something INSPIRED by elements you like but uniquely yours'", "Refuse the project entirely", "Copy it but change the colors"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Managing your own burnout: Working 12-hour design days for weeks leads to:", o: ["Faster project delivery", "Diminishing quality — creative work suffers under exhaustion, sustainable pace produces better design than caffeine-fueled marathons", "More portfolio pieces", "Client appreciation for your dedication"], c: 1 },
        { q: "When PM and client give contradicting design feedback:", o: ["Always follow the client over the PM", "Clarify with both parties together — misalignment between PM and client causes revision loops, alignment prevents wasted work", "Follow whichever feedback you agree with", "Pick whichever option is easier to implement"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A design you're proud of gets rejected by data (low conversion in A/B test). You should:", o: ["Argue that the test was flawed", "Accept the data — design's purpose is conversion, not self-expression, iterate based on what the numbers show", "Rerun the test hoping for different results", "Blame the copy or product for poor performance"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Client requests a red polka-dot background on a minimalist luxury store. You should:", o: ["Do exactly what they request", "Present your professional recommendation with mockups showing both options — educate don't dictate, but advocate for good design", "Refuse and explain why it's wrong", "Do it but warn them it won't look good"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Design critique from teammates should be:", o: ["Taken as personal attacks on your taste", "Welcomed as growth opportunities — diverse perspectives catch blind spots you'll never see yourself", "Ignored unless from senior designers", "Only accepted during formal review meetings"], c: 1 }

    task13Quiz: [
        { q: "AI tools like Midjourney in design workflow are best used for:", o: ["Replacing manual design work entirely", "Rapid ideation, mood board generation, and concept exploration — AI accelerates the creative phase but humans finalize", "Creating final deliverable assets", "Only generating placeholder images"], c: 1 },
        { q: "AI-generated design assets risk:", o: ["Nothing — AI produces perfect results", "Copyright ambiguity, generic outputs that lack brand personality, and quality inconsistencies — always customize AI outputs", "Only legal issues, quality is fine", "Being detected by clients as AI-generated"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Using AI to generate color palettes is effective because:", o: ["AI chooses better colors than humans", "AI can process color theory rules (complementary, analogous) instantly and suggest options — but designers validate against brand context", "AI palettes are always on-trend", "It eliminates the need for color psychology knowledge"], c: 1 },
        { q: "AI image upscaling tools help designers by:", o: ["Creating original images from scratch", "Enhancing low-resolution client assets to usable quality — saving projects when clients provide tiny logos or blurry photos", "Replacing the need for professional photography", "Automatically optimizing images for web"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The biggest risk of over-relying on AI design tools is:", o: ["They're too expensive for regular use", "Losing fundamental design skills — if you can't design without AI, you can't critically evaluate or customize AI output", "AI tools will become obsolete", "Clients don't accept AI-assisted work"], c: 1 },
        { q: "AI-powered prototyping helps designers by:", o: ["Replacing Figma entirely", "Generating layout variations faster — designers can explore more options in less time while maintaining creative control", "Creating final production code", "Running usability tests automatically"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Figma AI features (like auto layout suggestions) should be:", o: ["Used blindly for maximum efficiency", "Treated as starting points — AI suggestions need human review for brand consistency and design intent", "Avoided — manual work is always better", "The primary design workflow"], c: 1 },
        { q: "AI can generate design copy (placeholder text for mockups) but:", o: ["It should be published as final copy", "Lorem ipsum is safer — AI-generated copy in mockups may accidentally be published, and it's the content writer's job to finalize copy", "AI copy is always better than writer copy", "Designers should write final copy using AI"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The AI-powered designer's competitive advantage is:", o: ["Speed — AI makes everything faster automatically", "Combining AI efficiency with human creativity, brand understanding, and emotional intelligence — the hybrid skill set", "Being able to replace entire design teams", "Knowing the most AI tools"], c: 1 },
        { q: "AI design tools should follow the same QA process as manual design because:", o: ["AI output is always perfect", "AI makes subtle errors (wrong proportions, inconsistent spacing, off-brand elements) that only trained eyes catch in QA", "QA is not needed for AI-assisted work", "AI self-corrects during the generation process"], c: 1 }
