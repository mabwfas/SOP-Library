        { q: "Third-party apps impact: A store with 25 installed apps likely suffers from:", o: ["Better functionality", "JavaScript bloat — each app injects scripts that compete for browser resources, potentially adding 5+ seconds to load time", "No performance issues with modern apps", "Only aesthetic conflicts between apps"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Lazy loading should NOT be applied to:", o: ["Footer images", "The hero/LCP image — lazy loading the largest visible element delays the LCP metric, hurting Core Web Vitals", "Below-fold product images", "Background decorative images"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Font optimization: Loading 5 Google Font weights (300, 400, 500, 600, 700) is problematic because:", o: ["Google Fonts are slow", "Each weight is a separate file download — use only 2-3 weights (regular + bold) and font-display: swap", "Font weights don't affect page load", "System fonts are always better"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Preloading critical resources with <link rel='preload'> helps:", o: ["All resources equally", "Hero images and critical fonts — the browser fetches them first instead of discovering them during render", "Only JavaScript files", "Nothing — browsers are smart enough to prioritize"], c: 1 },
        { q: "JavaScript defer vs async: For non-critical scripts like analytics:", o: ["Use neither — scripts should load normally", "Use defer — script downloads in parallel but executes after HTML parsing, not blocking render", "Use async — execution order doesn't matter for non-critical scripts", "Inline all JavaScript to avoid extra requests"], c: 1 },
        { q: "CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): Images without width/height attributes cause:", o: ["No visual issues", "Layout jumps as images load — content shifts around, frustrating users and failing Core Web Vitals", "Only accessibility problems", "Slower image loading"], c: 1 },

        { q: "An app conflict causes the cart page to break. The debugging process:", o: ["Contact all app developers simultaneously", "Disable apps one-by-one to isolate the conflict — systematic elimination is faster than guessing", "Reinstall the theme", "Clear the browser cache"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Shopify Flow vs a custom app for automation:", o: ["Custom apps are always more powerful", "Flow handles common automations without code — only build custom when Flow can't do it, saving development time", "Flow is only for Shopify Plus", "They serve completely different purposes"], c: 1 },

        { q: "Third-party app scripts loading synchronously (blocking render) should be:", o: ["Left as-is — apps know best how to load", "Changed to async/defer where possible — blocking scripts hold up the entire page, impacting user experience", "Reported to the app developer only", "It doesn't matter with modern browsers"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Evaluating an app before installing: What matters most?", o: ["Star rating on the App Store", "JavaScript payload size, number of HTTP requests injected, mobile performance impact, and uninstall cleanliness", "Number of installs and reviews", "Price — more expensive apps are usually better"], c: 1 }
