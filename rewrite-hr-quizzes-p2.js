        // Offer & Negotiation
        { q: "A candidate accepts your ₹9LPA offer verbally. Two days later, they ask for ₹10.5LPA citing a competing offer. Your move:", o: ["Withdraw the offer — post-acceptance negotiation shows bad faith and predicts future behavior problems", "Match the competing offer to secure the candidate since restarting the search would cost more time and money", "Verify the competing offer exists by requesting the offer letter, then evaluate based on the candidate's value", "Hold firm at ₹9LPA — if they accepted once, they valued the role at that price and the competing offer changes nothing"], c: 2 },
        { q: "Your offer letter says 'CTC: ₹8LPA' but doesn't break down the structure. The candidate asks for a breakdown. Why is this important?", o: ["It's just a formality — CTC is the number that matters and candidates shouldn't need granular salary details", "Candidates who ask for breakdowns are overly detail-oriented and may be high-maintenance employees to manage", "Fixed vs variable split, PF deductions, and in-hand salary directly affect the candidate's decision and trust in the company", "Providing a breakdown creates legal complications if the company needs to restructure compensation later"], c: 2 },
        { q: "A candidate in final stages says 'I need 2 weeks to decide.' Your current open positions pipeline has no other strong candidates. Best approach:", o: ["Give them the full 2 weeks — rushing candidates leads to regretful acceptances and early attrition problems", "Give 5 business days with a clear deadline — 2 weeks signals low interest or active counter-offer shopping", "Pressure them for an immediate decision by implying other candidates are being considered for the same role", "Extend the deadline to 3 weeks to demonstrate flexibility and build goodwill before their employment starts"], c: 1 },
        { q: "During salary negotiation, a candidate says 'My friend in the same role at your company earns ₹2L more.' Your response should:", o: ["Share internal salary data to prove transparency and show the candidate that compensation is fair and equitable", "Explain that compensation varies based on experience, performance, and timing — then redirect to their value proposition", "Match the friend's salary immediately to avoid internal compensation complaints spreading through the organization", "Tell the candidate that discussing other employees' salaries violates company policy and is not professionally appropriate"], c: 1 },
        { q: "An offer has been extended. The candidate's current employer makes a counter-offer with 30% raise. Statistics show what about counter-offer acceptances?", o: ["Counter-offers work well — employees who accept them feel re-valued and typically stay for 3+ more productive years", "80% of candidates who accept counter-offers leave within 6-12 months — the root dissatisfaction remains unresolved", "Counter-offers are the most effective retention tool available to employers and should be encouraged as standard practice", "Whether counter-offers work depends entirely on the individual — there's no reliable statistical pattern to reference"], c: 1 },
        { q: "You're negotiating with a candidate who says 'I want work-from-home Fridays.' Company policy doesn't allow remote work. What's the HR negotiation approach?", o: ["Decline immediately — company policy is non-negotiable and exceptions create precedent that undermines organizational rules", "Offer alternative perks of equivalent value — flexible hours, extra leave, or professional development budget instead", "Agree to WFH Fridays secretly for this candidate only since attracting top talent requires occasional policy exceptions", "Ask the candidate to join first and raise the WFH request after 6 months once they've proven their productivity"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The time between verbal acceptance and formal offer letter should ideally be:", o: ["Within 24-48 hours — delays create anxiety, invite counter-offers, and signal disorganization to the candidate", "5-7 business days to allow thorough legal review of the offer terms and internal approval chain completion", "2 weeks is standard practice for most companies to process paperwork through HR and finance departments", "Timing doesn't matter significantly — the verbal commitment is binding and candidates will wait for the formalities"], c: 0 },
        { q: "A candidate negotiates for a designation upgrade from 'Senior Developer' to 'Lead Developer' at the same salary. Should you agree?", o: ["Yes — it costs nothing and shows flexibility that increases the candidate's commitment to accepting the offer", "No — inflated designations create team hierarchy confusion and set unrealistic expectations for responsibilities", "Evaluate the impact — does the designation match the role scope, and what precedent does it set for existing team members", "Always agree to designation requests since they're symbolic and employees care more about actual responsibilities"], c: 2 },
        { q: "An offer is rescinded after background verification reveals a discrepancy. The candidate threatens legal action. Your protection comes from:", o: ["The verbal agreement during the phone screen where salary expectations were discussed and mutually confirmed", "Having a documented, transparent process with the discrepancy clearly communicated before rescinding the offer", "The company's general legal counsel who handles all employment disputes regardless of documentation quality", "Background check consent forms that the candidate signed during the application process authorizing verification"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The biggest mistake HR makes during salary negotiation is:", o: ["Starting too high — this leaves no room for the candidate to feel they 'won' something during the negotiation", "Focusing only on salary — total compensation includes growth, learning, culture, and long-term career trajectory", "Being too transparent about budget ranges — this gives candidates unfair leverage during compensation discussions", "Taking too long to respond to candidate counter-proposals — speed demonstrates organizational commitment to hiring"], c: 1 },

        { q: "A new hire's Day 1 experience: they arrive and no one knows they're starting. Their laptop isn't ready. The desk is occupied. This is a failure of:", o: ["The IT department for not provisioning equipment based on the start date provided by HR weeks in advance", "The onboarding process — HR should have a checklist triggered by offer acceptance covering all departments", "The hiring manager who should have prepared their team and workspace for the new member's first day", "The new hire for not confirming their start date and requirements with their direct manager before arriving"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The 30-60-90 day plan for a new hire should be created by:", o: ["HR alone — they understand onboarding best practices and can create standardized plans for all departments", "The hiring manager with HR support — the manager defines role-specific goals while HR ensures process compliance", "The new hire themselves — it demonstrates initiative and ensures they take ownership of their integration", "The CEO or department head — senior leadership should set expectations for every new employee who joins"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A new hire's mentor reports that the employee seems disengaged after week 2. The FIRST thing HR should do:", o: ["Schedule a formal meeting and document the disengagement for potential probation period termination records", "Have an informal 1:1 check-in — ask about challenges, expectations vs reality, and what support they need", "Wait until the 30-day review — 2 weeks is too early to draw conclusions about long-term engagement levels", "Notify the hiring manager and recommend closer supervision to prevent further disengagement from escalating"], c: 1 },
        { q: "During onboarding, a new developer says 'The tech stack is different from what was described in the interview.' This risk should have been mitigated by:", o: ["Having the candidate sign an acknowledgment of the job description during the offer stage for legal protection", "Transparent JDs and interview discussions that accurately represent daily work, tools, and technology environment", "A trial period clause in the offer letter allowing either party to exit without notice during the first month", "Post-interview feedback surveys that capture candidate expectations for comparison with actual role requirements"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Onboarding metrics: Which KPI BEST predicts long-term retention at the 1-year mark?", o: ["Speed to full productivity — employees who reach targets faster tend to stay longer due to early achievement", "New hire satisfaction score at 90 days — this captures cultural integration, role clarity, and relationship building", "Time-to-fill for the original position — faster hiring processes correlate with better candidate-role alignment", "Completion rate of onboarding training modules — employees who finish training early demonstrate higher engagement"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A new hire is underperforming at Week 6 of a 90-day probation. The manager wants immediate termination. HR's guidance:", o: ["Support termination — the probation period exists specifically for quick exits when performance doesn't meet standards", "Ensure documented feedback was provided — if no formal performance conversations occurred, you can't fairly terminate", "Extend probation by 30 days automatically since 6 weeks is insufficient to evaluate any employee's true capability", "Transfer the employee to a different team before considering termination to rule out manager-employee mismatch"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The most overlooked element of onboarding that directly impacts cultural integration is:", o: ["Providing a comprehensive employee handbook covering all company policies and standard procedures on Day 1", "Assigning peer buddies for social integration — technical onboarding is easy, belonging is what makes people stay", "Scheduling meet-and-greets with senior leadership to make new hires feel valued and recognized from day one", "Creating an onboarding portal with self-service resources so new hires can learn at their preferred pace"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A new hire says 'I don't feel challenged enough' during their Week 3 check-in. The correct interpretation is:", o: ["They're arrogant — give them time to learn the system before seeking challenges on their own initiative", "Positive signal — they're engaged and ready for more, adjust their ramp plan to match their learning speed", "Wait and see — most employees feel this way initially and naturally find their challenge level over time", "Assign them the most complex project immediately to test whether their confidence matches their actual ability"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Buddy/mentor assignment during onboarding should follow which principle?", o: ["Assign the most senior person available — they have the deepest knowledge to share with new team members", "Choose someone from a different department to broaden the new hire's network across the organization", "Select a high-performing peer at a similar level — relatable mentors create psychological safety and honest exchange", "The buddy role is informal and doesn't require specific selection criteria — any willing volunteer is suitable"], c: 2 },
        { q: "An employee's probation review at 90 days reveals 'meets expectations' across all areas but the manager says 'something feels off.' HR should:", o: ["Confirm the employee since they objectively meet all measurable expectations and gut feelings aren't evidence", "Probe the manager's concern — ask for specific behavioral examples that triggered the concern for documentation", "Extend probation by another 30 days to give the manager more time to articulate and validate their concern", "Override the manager's feeling — if the scorecard shows 'meets expectations,' the process should be respected"], c: 1 },

        // Performance Management - Reviews & PIPs
        { q: "A manager rates all 8 team members as 'Exceeds Expectations.' HR should:", o: ["Accept it — the manager knows their team best and interfering undermines managerial authority and autonomy", "Challenge with calibration — statistically, all 8 exceeding expectations suggests rating inflation or unclear standards", "Adjust the ratings yourself to force a bell curve distribution since that's what senior leadership expects", "Accept for now but note the manager for coaching on rating standards before the next review cycle begins"], c: 1 },
        { q: "An employee on a 60-day PIP shows improvement in Week 2 but slips back by Week 6. What's the correct call?", o: ["Close the PIP as successful since they demonstrated the capability to improve when properly motivated", "The slip-back indicates the improvement wasn't sustainable — extend the PIP by 30 days for final validation", "Terminate immediately — inconsistent improvement during a PIP reveals a fundamental performance ceiling", "Week 2 improvement was likely performative — sustained regression confirms the original performance assessment"], c: 1 },
        { q: "During a performance review, an employee disagrees with their rating and refuses to sign the review form. Correct HR protocol:", o: ["Force signature — the review is mandatory documentation and refusal to sign is insubordination that requires escalation", "Document the disagreement, allow the employee to add written comments, and proceed with the review on file", "Change the rating to satisfy the employee — unresolved disagreements create legal risks and employee relations issues", "Escalate to the employee's skip-level manager to mediate the disagreement and determine the appropriate rating"], c: 1 },
        { q: "KRA vs KPI — a content writer's KRA is 'Create high-quality blog content.'

        { q: "A high performer requests feedback outside the formal review cycle. The manager says 'We'll discuss it in the annual review.' HR should:", o: ["Support the manager — maintaining the formal review schedule ensures consistency across all employees", "Coach the manager — high performers who seek feedback and get delayed lose engagement, continuous feedback is critical", "Create a policy mandating quarterly feedback sessions to prevent this situation from recurring in the future", "Tell the employee to be patient since annual reviews exist specifically for comprehensive performance discussions"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A PIP document should include all EXCEPT:", o: ["Specific performance gaps with measurable examples drawn from the current review period documentation", "Clear targets with deadlines and the support/resources the company will provide during the improvement period", "A statement that failure to improve will result in 'possible' action — keeping consequences intentionally vague", "Regular check-in schedule (weekly/biweekly) with the manager to review progress and provide coaching"], c: 2 },
        { q: "360-degree feedback reveals that an employee's peers and subordinates rate them significantly lower than their manager does. This gap suggests:", o: ["The peers and subordinates are biased — the manager's direct observation is the most reliable data point available", "The employee 'manages up' well but lacks the collaborative and leadership skills visible to anyone except their direct boss", "360-degree feedback is inherently unreliable due to personal conflicts and should be weighted lower than manager assessments", "The gap is normal — managers evaluate performance while peers evaluate personality and those are different constructs"], c: 1 },
        { q: "An employee's performance has been 'Meets Expectations' for 3 consecutive years. No improvement, no decline. What's the HR concern?", o: ["No concern — consistent performance at expectation level is exactly what most roles require for business stability", "Stagnation risk — a plateaued employee may become disengaged, and the lack of growth indicates limited potential or motivation", "This is the ideal employee profile — reliable, predictable, and low-maintenance performers are the backbone of teams", "Only a concern if the employee is in a leadership track — individual contributors can plateau without negative consequences"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Legal requirement: Before terminating an employee for poor performance in India, the employer MUST have:", o: ["Verbal agreement from the employee's manager that termination is the only remaining option for the situation", "Documented evidence of performance gaps, feedback given, improvement opportunities provided, and failure to meet PIP targets", "Approval from the company's legal team regardless of the documentation quality or performance management history", "A minimum of 6 months of documented underperformance since Indian labor law requires this specific time frame"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Self-assessments in performance reviews serve what primary purpose?", o: ["They're a formality — managers rarely change their ratings based on what employees write about themselves", "They reveal perception gaps — comparing self-rating vs manager-rating identifies blind spots for coaching conversations", "They protect the company legally by showing the employee had an opportunity to participate in the evaluation process", "They help HR generate report data on employee satisfaction without requiring separate engagement survey tools"], c: 1 },

        // Policies & Compliance
        { q: "An employee discovers a colleague is working a second full-time job without company approval. Under Digital Heroes policy, this is:", o: ["Fine as long as performance remains unaffected — what employees do outside work hours is their personal choice", "A terminable offense — undisclosed dual employment creates conflict of interest and confidentiality risks", "Only a concern if the second job is with a competitor — non-competing external work is generally acceptable", "Something HR should monitor quietly without confronting the employee to avoid unnecessary conflict or accusations"], c: 1 },
        { q: "An employee's social media post criticizes the company without naming it directly. HR's assessment:", o: ["Not actionable — if the company isn't named, there's no policy violation and free speech applies to all employees", "Investigate context — indirect public criticism can damage employer brand and may violate social media policy terms", "Immediate termination — any negativity about the workplace, even unnamed, shows disloyalty and cultural misalignment", "Monitor but take no action — social media policing creates a toxic surveillance culture that erodes employee trust"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A manager asks HR to change an employee's leave record from 'sick leave' to 'loss of pay' retroactively. The employee used valid sick leave. This request:", o: ["Is reasonable — managers have discretion over leave approvals and can adjust records based on operational needs", "Violates leave policy integrity — retroactive changes to valid leave usage are unethical and potentially illegal", "Should be approved if the employee was already warned about excessive sick leave usage during that period", "Can be processed with the employee's written consent since both parties agree to the reclassification terms"], c: 1 },
        { q: "According to company policy, the FIRST escalation path for an employee who has a conflict with their direct manager is:", o: ["Post about it on internal communication channels to get peer perspective and crowd-source a fair resolution", "Take it directly to the CEO since managers can't be trusted to fairly handle complaints about themselves", "Report to HR or the Delhi Team — company policy specifies these as the ONLY appropriate escalation channels", "Address it directly with the manager first in a one-on-one meeting before involving any third parties"], c: 2 },
        { q: "An employee is found sharing confidential client data on a personal WhatsApp group. Under zero-tolerance policy, this results in:", o: ["Written warning for first offense — immediate termination is disproportionate for a messaging platform slip", "Immediate termination and potential legal action — confidentiality breach is a zero-tolerance violation with no warnings", "Verbal counseling and mandatory data security training since the employee may not have understood the seriousness", "Suspension pending investigation — the intent behind sharing determines whether termination is appropriate or excessive"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Digital Heroes policy on workplace relationships between employees in the same reporting chain states:", o: ["No restrictions — personal relationships are private matters that the company should not regulate or monitor", "Mandatory disclosure to HR — the company needs to manage potential conflicts of interest in reporting structures", "Automatic termination of one employee — workplace relationships in the same chain are absolutely prohibited", "Relationships are permitted but the employees must voluntarily agree to never discuss work matters outside office"], c: 1 },
        { q: "An employee submits a medical certificate for 3 days of sick leave. The certificate looks suspicious (different handwriting, no clinic stamp). HR should:", o: ["Accept it since questioning medical certificates invades employee privacy and demonstrates institutional distrust", "Verify with the issuing doctor/clinic — fraudulent medical certificates are grounds for disciplinary action", "Reject the leave request immediately and convert the days to loss-of-pay without any investigation or discussion", "Accept this time but put the employee on a watchlist for future suspicious medical leave claims and patterns"], c: 1 },
        { q: "An intern asks if they're eligible for equity sharing. According to Digital Heroes policy:", o: ["No — interns are temporary employees and equity sharing is reserved for full-time permanent staff members", "Yes — equity sharing starts from Day 1 for all team members, including interns, as stated in the company manifesto", "Only after conversion to full-time employment following the internship period and probation completion", "It depends on the internship duration — only interns serving 6+ months qualify for equity sharing benefits"], c: 1 },
        { q: "POSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment) compliance requires every company with 10+ employees to:", o: ["Have a general anti-harassment policy mentioned somewhere in the employee handbook for reference purposes", "Constitute an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) with specific composition requirements and conduct awareness training", "Designate the HR head as the sole recipient of harassment complaints with full authority to investigate and resolve", "Post anti-harassment posters in common areas and include a brief mention during new employee orientation sessions"], c: 1 },
        { q: "An employee requests to work remotely for 3 months due to a family emergency. Company policy allows 0 remote days. The correct HR approach:", o: ["Deny the request citing policy — making exceptions undermines rules and creates precedent for all future requests", "Evaluate the employee's track record, role suitability, and specific circumstances — recommend a temporary exception with clear terms", "Approve automatically to demonstrate compassion — the company values people over rigid policy enforcement", "Offer unpaid leave instead since the company can't accommodate remote work and the employee needs time off"], c: 1 },

        // Employee Relations - Conflict & Culture
        { q: "Two team members come to HR with contradicting accounts of the same incident. Neither has witnesses.

        { q: "You notice a pattern: 3 employees from the same team have independently complained about their manager's behavior in the past 2 months. This triggers:", o: ["A skip-level meeting between the employees and the manager's supervisor to air grievances in a mediated setting", "A formal investigation into the manager's conduct — multiple independent complaints establish a potential pattern of misconduct", "Coaching for the employees since three complaints might indicate a team with unrealistic expectations of management style", "No action until a formal written complaint is filed — verbal or informal concerns don't meet the investigation threshold"], c: 1 },
        { q: "An employee complains that their colleague plays loud music during work hours. The colleague says they need it to focus. HR should:", o: ["Tell the complaining employee to use noise-cancelling headphones — personal preferences shouldn't restrict others' behavior", "Mediate a resolution — suggest designated quiet zones, headphone policies, or scheduling compromises that respect both needs", "Issue a blanket no-music policy to eliminate all potential disputes and create a standardized quiet work environment", "Tell the music-playing employee to stop immediately since office spaces default to quiet and music is a privilege"], c: 1 },
        { q: "During an employee relations investigation, you discover that a witness's statement contradicts their earlier chat messages. How do you handle this?", o: ["Ignore the discrepancy — people remember events differently over time and chat messages lack context and nuance", "Address it directly with the witness — present both versions and ask them to clarify, as credibility is essential", "Use only the written chat evidence since documented communications are more legally defensible than verbal statements", "Disqualify the witness entirely from the investigation since their inconsistency undermines their reliability"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A senior leader asks HR to 'quietly exit' an employee without documentation 'to avoid drama.' Your response:", o: ["Comply — senior leaders have organizational context that HR may not be aware of and their judgment should be trusted", "Decline — every exit requires documentation for legal protection, compliance, and to prevent wrongful termination claims", "Compromise by creating minimal documentation after the termination to satisfy legal requirements retroactively", "Ask another HR team member to handle it since you're uncomfortable with the request but don't want to refuse leadership"], c: 1 },

        { q: "Handling 'conspiracy and negativity' per Digital Heroes policy: An employee privately tells 3 colleagues that 'management is unfair.' This violates:", o: ["Nothing — employees have the right to discuss working conditions with colleagues under freedom of expression", "Company policy — complaints must go through HR or Delhi Team ONLY, spreading negativity among colleagues is prohibited", "Only if the statement is factually false — truthful criticism of management is protected employee communication", "Nothing if done privately — the policy only covers public criticism on social media or external platforms"], c: 1 },

HR's highest-priority action:", o: ["Separate them into different teams immediately to protect project delivery timelines and team overall productivity", "Mediate and document — attempt resolution first, but establish clear behavioral expectations with consequences for both parties", "Terminate the one with lower seniority to send a clear message that personal conflicts won't be tolerated in the workplace", "Let them work it out — star performers are mature enough to separate personal feelings from professional responsibilities"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Building a positive workplace culture is primarily the responsibility of:", o: ["HR — culture initiatives, policies, and programs are core HR functions that should be centrally designed and managed", "Everyone — but HR architects the framework, leaders model it, and employees sustain it through daily behaviors and choices", "Senior leadership exclusively — culture flows top-down and employees simply adapt to whatever culture leadership establishes", "No single party — culture develops organically from team dynamics and cannot be deliberately shaped through programs"], c: 1 },
        { q: "An exit interview reveals the departing employee's manager regularly takes credit for the team's work. How should HR use this information?", o: ["File it for reference but take no action — exit interview feedback is often emotionally charged and unreliable", "Cross-reference with other team members' engagement data and previous complaints to validate the pattern before acting", "Immediately confront the manager with the accusation to get their side of the story while details are fresh", "Share the exit interview feedback verbatim with the manager's supervisor to ensure accountability and transparency"], c: 1 },

        // Offboarding - Exit protocol
        { q: "An employee submits resignation with immediate effect, citing a competitor offer. Company policy requires 30-day notice. HR should:", o: ["Accept immediate resignation — forcing someone who wants to leave to stay 30 days creates security and morale risks", "Enforce the full 30-day notice period — policy exists for knowledge transfer and project continuity protection", "Negotiate — explain notice period importance, offer to expedite if they complete a structured knowledge transfer in 15 days", "Report the employee to the competitor for poaching and consider legal action for breach of notice period obligations"], c: 2 },

HR should:", o: ["Automatically accept the withdrawal — retention is always better and cheaper than replacement hiring costs", "Evaluate case-by-case — consider their reason for resigning, their performance history, and potential counter-offer engagement risk", "Refuse the withdrawal — once resignation is submitted, the decision should be final to maintain professional standards", "Accept only if their replacement hasn't been hired yet — practical considerations should drive the decision logic"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Final settlement after resignation should legally be processed within:", o: ["30 days of the last working day — this is standard practice for most organizations with established payroll systems", "By the next payroll cycle — practical convenience for the finance team outweighs any urgency the employee might feel", "Within 2 working days of the last day — delayed settlements violate employee rights and damage employer reputation", "Immediately on the last working day — the employee should walk out with all financial matters completely settled"], c: 2 },

        { q: "A pattern emerges: 60% of exits in the past quarter are from the same department. What does this signal?", o: ["Normal variance — some departments naturally have higher turnover due to role type and industry labor market dynamics", "A systemic issue — likely management, culture, or workload problems specific to that department requiring immediate investigation", "The department hired too many people recently and natural attrition is correcting the headcount to sustainable levels", "The department leader is effectively managing out underperformers which represents healthy organizational self-correction"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Social media and company brand considerations during offboarding include:", o: ["No special handling needed — what former employees post about the company after leaving is entirely their prerogative", "Reminding departing employees of NDA and social media policy terms, and ensuring they leave with a positive final experience", "Monitoring former employees' social media accounts for 6 months after departure to protect company reputation online", "Requesting former employees delete all company-related posts from their personal social media accounts before leaving"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The MOST valuable long-term outcome of a well-conducted offboarding process is:", o: ["Reduced legal liability from properly documented exits that protect the company from wrongful termination claims", "Alumni advocacy — well-treated departing employees become brand ambassadors, referral sources, and sometimes return as boomerang hires", "Clean data — ensuring all system access is revoked and company property is returned protects information security", "Efficient knowledge transfer that preserves institutional knowledge and minimizes disruption to ongoing project timelines"], c: 1 },

This disconnect suggests:", o: ["The training was ineffective — scoring well didn't translate to practical competence, indicating a curriculum design flaw", "The employee is capable but unmotivated — high test scores prove ability, so the issue is engagement not competence", "The exam was too easy and didn't adequately test applied knowledge — revise the exam to include practical scenarios", "All of these are possible — the correct diagnosis requires investigating training design, management support, and role fit simultaneously"], c: 3 },
        { q: "Across all HR functions, which single metric BEST represents overall HR effectiveness?", o: ["Time-to-fill — faster hiring demonstrates efficient talent acquisition and strong employer brand in the market", "Employee engagement score — it captures the cumulative impact of hiring quality, onboarding, culture, and management effectiveness", "Cost-per-hire — keeping recruitment costs low while maintaining quality demonstrates efficient resource utilization", "Offer acceptance rate — high acceptance rates prove the company's value proposition resonates with target candidates"], c: 1 },
        { q: "You inherit an HR department with zero documentation — no policies, no templates, no exit records. Priority order for building from scratch:", o: ["Engagement surveys → Policies → Templates → Process documentation, since you need to understand sentiment first", "Everything simultaneously — each area is equally critical and delays in any area creates organizational risk", "Core policies (leave, conduct, POSH) → Hiring templates → Onboarding SOP → Performance framework → Exit process", "Templates → Policies → Performance reviews → Recruitment, since templates are fastest to create and show immediate results"], c: 2 },

The STRONGEST answer uses:", o: ["Total recruitment cost savings from in-house hiring versus external agency fees for all positions filled this year", "Revenue-per-employee growth, attrition cost reduction, time-to-productivity improvement, and engagement-to-performance correlation data", "List of all HR programs implemented, training sessions conducted, and policies created during the reporting period", "Comparison of HR headcount ratio versus industry benchmarks showing the department operates lean and efficiently"], c: 1 },
        { q: "You notice that hiring managers across 3 departments are each using different interview processes, scoring methods, and offer structures. This creates:", o: ["Healthy diversity in approach — different departments have different needs and standardization would be counterproductive", "Compliance risk, inconsistent candidate experience, impossible-to-compare data, and potential discrimination exposure across the organization", "Minor inefficiency that HR should address gradually over 12-18 months to avoid disrupting departmental workflows currently", "No real issue — as long as each department fills their roles successfully, the process variations are inconsequential"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The ethical dilemma: A candidate reveals during reference check that their current employer doesn't know they're job searching. The reference provided works at a different company. This is:", o: ["A red flag — honest candidates inform their current employer and searching secretly indicates trustworthiness concerns", "Completely normal and expected — most candidates search confidentially, which is why you check non-current references first", "Grounds for additional scrutiny — request more references to compensate for the inability to verify current performance directly", "Only acceptable for entry-level positions — senior candidates should always be transparent about their job search activity"], c: 1 },
        { q: "After implementing all 13 tasks of this training, what DEFINES an HR professional vs an HR administrator?", o: ["An HR administrator follows processes — an HR professional anticipates needs, influences decisions, and drives business outcomes", "The difference is primarily seniority and title — both roles perform the same fundamental functions at different scales", "HR professionals focus on strategy while administrators handle execution — the two roles should operate independently", "An HR professional has an MBA or HR certification while an administrator may have only a bachelor's degree or equivalent"], c: 0 },
        { q: "A startup founder says 'HR is overhead — we don't need it until we're 50+ people.' Your evidence-based refutation:", o: ["HR overhead concern is valid — startups should outsource HR functions until the cost of a full-time hire is justified", "Without HR from early stage, you build culture accidentally, hire inconsistently, and create legal exposure that compounds over time", "Agree partially — startups under 20 employees can rely on the founder for HR functions with occasional legal consultation", "HR is a compliance requirement — labor law mandates HR functions at any company size regardless of the founder's preference"], c: 1 },
