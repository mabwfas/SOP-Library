What's the immediate risk?", o: ["The verbal promises could create legal liability if they exceed approved compensation bands for the role", "The team lead is simply being proactive and this shows good ownership of the hiring process overall", "This only matters if the candidates actually accept — verbal promises aren't legally binding in most cases", "The primary concern is that the team lead might be hiring friends rather than qualified candidates here"], c: 0 },
        { q: "A hiring manager says 'I don't need HR in interviews, I know my domain.' The correct principle to apply is:", o: ["Respect their expertise — domain leaders are better judges of technical capability than HR generalists", "Explain that HR evaluates culture fit, red flags, and ensures compliance that domain experts typically miss", "Ask the Delhi Team to mandate HR presence so the hiring manager can't refuse the standard protocol", "Compromise by joining only final-round interviews to minimize friction with the hiring manager's process"], c: 1 },

What's the problem?", o: ["An inflated requirements list filters out strong candidates who have transferable skills but lack one niche tool", "The JD is thorough — better to over-specify than under-specify to avoid getting irrelevant applications", "Framework versions change rapidly so listing them shows the company stays current with technology trends", "Having 15 requirements is standard for senior roles and helps recruiters screen candidates more efficiently"], c: 0 },
        { q: "You're writing a JD for a customer service role. The manager says 'Just copy the one from Naukri.' Why is this problematic?", o: ["Generic JDs attract generic candidates — your JD should reflect YOUR company's specific challenges and culture", "Naukri JDs are usually well-written by professionals and serve as reliable templates for most positions", "Copying saves time and ensures industry-standard formatting that candidates are already familiar with", "The main issue is potential plagiarism — you should paraphrase the Naukri JD rather than copying verbatim"], c: 0 },

        { q: "A JD says 'Must have 10 years experience' for a role using a technology that's only existed for 4 years. What does this signal?", o: ["The hiring manager genuinely needs deep expertise and is willing to wait for the perfect candidate match", "The JD was written without HR review — experience requirements are disconnected from reality and will filter good candidates", "This is a negotiation tactic to attract only the most confident candidates who apply despite the requirement", "Ten years of total experience with similar technologies is a reasonable proxy for expertise in newer tools"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Your company's JDs consistently produce 200+ applications but only 3-5 quality candidates. The MOST likely cause is:", o: ["The job boards you're using attract high-volume, low-quality applicant pools that don't match your needs", "The JD's requirements section is too vague — not differentiating between 'must-have' and 'nice-to-have' skills", "You need to invest in premium job board listings that offer better candidate targeting algorithms", "The application process is too easy — adding more screening questions would filter low-quality applicants"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A JD includes 'Only males aged 25-35 should apply.' As HR, your response is:", o: ["Remove it immediately — this violates anti-discrimination laws and exposes the company to legal liability", "Keep it if the hiring manager insists since they understand the team dynamics better than HR does", "Replace 'males' with 'candidates' but keep the age requirement since it indicates experience level needed", "Forward to legal for review since some roles may have legitimate occupational requirements for demographics"], c: 0 },
        { q: "The 'Day in the Life' section of a JD serves what strategic purpose?", o: ["It pads the JD length to appear more professional and detailed compared to competitor job postings", "It lets candidates self-select out if the daily reality doesn't match their expectations, reducing early attrition", "It's primarily useful for entry-level roles where candidates have limited understanding of workplace norms", "It demonstrates transparency to job boards, which rank detailed JDs higher in search results algorithms"], c: 1 },
        { q: "You need to hire a senior developer but the approved CTC is below market rate. How should the JD handle this?", o: ["Don't mention salary and hope strong candidates apply based on the role description and company brand", "Emphasize total value — equity, learning, growth trajectory, and unique projects that compensate for lower CTC", "Inflate the JD title to 'Principal Engineer' to justify the lower salary with a more prestigious designation", "Post the role with market-rate salary range and negotiate down during the offer stage with selected candidates"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A well-crafted JD typically results in which measurable outcome?", o: ["Higher application volume across all job boards, demonstrating broader market reach and employer brand visibility", "Shorter time-to-fill because qualified candidates self-identify and the screening process becomes more efficient", "Lower cost-per-hire since the company receives more organic applications and reduces dependency on agencies", "Higher offer acceptance rates because candidates who read detailed JDs tend to be more committed overall"], c: 1 },
        { q: "What's the key difference between a JD for Naukri vs LinkedIn?", o: ["LinkedIn JDs can leverage your company page, employee advocacy, and network effects — requiring different tone and structure", "There's no meaningful difference — the same JD should be posted identically across all platforms for consistency", "Naukri requires more keywords for search optimization while LinkedIn prioritizes visual formatting elements", "LinkedIn is only effective for executive-level hiring while Naukri covers all levels equally well"], c: 0 },

        { q: "Your referral program offers ₹10K per hire but generates zero referrals. The MOST likely reason is:", o: ["The incentive amount is too low — employees won't risk their reputation for only ₹10K per referral", "The process is cumbersome — employees don't know how to refer, when they get paid, or what roles are open", "Employees don't have networks that match the company's hiring needs and technical skill requirements", "The company culture isn't strong enough for employees to confidently recommend it to their personal network"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A sourcing specialist relies exclusively on Naukri for all positions. What's the strategic risk?", o: ["Naukri is the market leader in India so single-channel sourcing through it is actually the most efficient approach", "Single-channel dependency means you miss passive candidates on LinkedIn and niche communities like GitHub or Stack Overflow", "The cost of a single platform subscription is lower and allows better budget allocation to other HR priorities", "Naukri provides sufficient candidate diversity for most roles across all experience levels and specializations"], c: 1 },
        { q: "You're sourcing for a niche role — Shopify Plus developer with B2B experience. Where do you look BEYOND job boards?", o: ["Post on general social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram where a broader audience will see the listing", "Shopify Partner directories, GitHub contributors to Shopify repos, and Shopify community forums where specialists congregate", "Wait for applications to come in organically since niche candidates actively search for relevant opportunities", "Contact local engineering colleges and offer internship-to-hire programs to develop the talent internally"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Campus recruitment at a Tier-3 college yields 50 resumes. What's the realistic quality expectation?", o: ["Expect 2-3 trainable candidates maximum — focus on aptitude and attitude rather than current technical skills", "All 50 should meet minimum requirements since the college's curriculum covers industry-standard fundamentals", "Skip Tier-3 colleges entirely — the screening cost exceeds the hiring value for professional-grade positions", "Expect about 15-20 good candidates since Tier-3 colleges have improved their placement training significantly"], c: 0 },
        { q: "A competitor just laid off 200 people in your city. How should HR respond strategically?", o: ["Wait for those candidates to apply to your open positions since they'll be actively job searching already", "Immediately post generic 'We're hiring!' messages on social media to capture attention from displaced workers", "Proactively source from the layoff list — identify roles that match, reach out directly with personalized messages", "Avoid hiring from competitors as those employees may carry institutional biases and conflicting work cultures"], c: 2 },
        { q: "Boolean search string: (Python OR Django) AND (Jaipur OR remote) NOT intern.

        { q: "Your sourcing pipeline shows 100 candidates contacted, 20 responded, 5 interviewed, 0 hired. Where's the bottleneck?", o: ["The initial sourcing criteria is too broad — casting a wide net is bringing in candidates that look relevant but aren't", "The interview stage is the problem — 5 interviews with 0 hires suggests unrealistic expectations or poor assessment", "The response rate of 20% is actually strong — the issue is probably compensation competitiveness or employer brand", "All metrics are concerning — 0 hires from 100 candidates indicates fundamental problems across the entire funnel"], c: 1 },
        { q: "What makes employee referrals the highest-quality sourcing channel according to HR best practices?", o: ["Referred candidates cost less to hire since you save on job board fees and agency commissions entirely", "Employees pre-screen for culture fit and skill match — they stake their reputation, creating a natural quality filter", "Referral hires start faster because they can skip the standard background check and verification processes", "Referred candidates accept lower salaries because they trust the recommending employee's endorsement of the company"], c: 1 },

For a company hiring across tech and non-tech roles, which provides maximum ROI?", o: ["Naukri — broadest reach for the Indian market across all job types, experience levels, and geographic locations", "LinkedIn Recruiter — access to passive candidates, advanced search, and InMail capabilities for direct outreach", "A niche technical job board that specializes in developer hiring since tech roles are hardest to fill", "An AI-powered resume screening tool that automates candidate matching across multiple free job board platforms"], c: 0 },

        { q: "You receive 100 resumes for a Senior PM role. The JD requires 5+ years experience and e-commerce background. A resume shows 4 years PM experience at Flipkart. Your decision:", o: ["Shortlist — Flipkart e-commerce experience compensates for the one-year gap and demonstrates relevant domain expertise", "Reject — the JD clearly states 5+ years and making exceptions undermines the screening criteria consistency", "Place in 'maybe' pile — good background but technically doesn't meet the minimum qualification threshold", "Auto-reject using ATS filters since the experience field doesn't match the 5-year minimum requirement set"], c: 0 },
        { q: "A resume has 3 jobs in 18 months. The candidate explains each was a contract role. How should you process this?", o: ["Auto-reject — 3 jobs in 18 months is a red flag regardless of explanation and indicates instability risk", "Verify the contract claim by requesting offer letters or work orders before proceeding to phone screen", "Shortlist if skills match — contract work is increasingly common and doesn't indicate commitment issues", "Reject but save the resume for future contract-based openings where short tenures are expected and acceptable"], c: 1 },
        { q: "An ATS ranks a candidate #47 out of 100, but you notice their cover letter describes solving the exact problem your company faces. What should you do?", o: ["Trust the ATS ranking — it's designed to objectively evaluate candidates better than subjective human review", "Pull the resume for manual review — ATS keyword matching misses contextual relevance that humans can evaluate", "Ignore cover letters entirely since they're often written by AI tools and don't reflect genuine capability", "Only review candidates ranked in the top 20 by ATS to maintain process efficiency and time management"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A resume lists 'Proficient in MS Office' as a key skill for a Digital Marketing Manager application. This tells you:", o: ["The candidate has essential computer literacy skills that form the foundation for any marketing technology role", "The candidate likely lacks specialized marketing skills — they're padding with basic competencies that shouldn't need listing", "MS Office proficiency is still relevant for creating marketing reports and presentations for stakeholders", "This is standard resume formatting in India where candidates list all technical skills comprehensively"], c: 1 },
        { q: "You're screening for a customer service role paying ₹3.5LPA. A candidate with 8 years of managerial experience applies.

        { q: "Two resumes: Candidate A has a perfect format with buzzwords but generic achievements. Candidate B has poor formatting but specific metrics ('Increased retention by 23%'). Who do you shortlist?", o: ["Candidate A — professional presentation demonstrates attention to detail which is critical for any role", "Candidate B — specific metrics indicate real impact, formatting can be improved but results can't be faked", "Both — let the phone screen differentiate between presentation skills and actual performance capabilities", "Neither without running them through ATS first — manual screening introduces bias and inconsistency"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A resume shows a 2-year employment gap. The candidate is female and the gap period coincides with typical maternity timeline. How should HR screen this?", o: ["Note the gap as a risk factor and prioritize candidates without employment gaps for scheduling efficiency", "Treat it identically to any other gap — evaluate skills and relevance without assumptions about the reason", "Skip the screening question about gaps entirely to avoid any appearance of discrimination during the process", "Automatically advance to phone screen to demonstrate the company's commitment to diversity and inclusion"], c: 1 },

What needs fixing?", o: ["The hiring managers are being too selective — coach them on evaluating potential rather than perfection", "Your screening criteria is misaligned with what hiring managers actually need — recalibrate with them immediately", "Increase the initial shortlist to 25 so that even with 80% rejection, 5 quality candidates reach final rounds", "The interview process is flawed — hiring managers need better interview training and structured evaluation forms"], c: 1 },
        { q: "When screening 100 resumes, what's the recommended time allocation per resume for initial screening pass?", o: ["5-7 minutes per resume to thoroughly evaluate each candidate's full career history and skill alignment", "30-60 seconds for initial scan — focus on knockout criteria first, then deep-review only shortlisted candidates", "2-3 minutes per resume provides the optimal balance between thoroughness and screening efficiency", "Let ATS handle all initial screening — human review should only start after automated ranking is complete"], c: 1 },

        { q: "A candidate provides 3 references: their mother, their college friend, and a former colleague. What's the screening issue?", o: ["No issue — personal references provide valuable insights into the candidate's character and interpersonal skills", "Only professional references from direct supervisors carry weight — the other two offer biased, non-work perspectives", "The colleague reference is sufficient — requesting additional professional references would be excessive for this stage", "Personal references are only problematic for senior roles — for entry-level positions, they're perfectly acceptable"], c: 1 },
        { q: "During a reference check, a former manager reveals the candidate was on a PIP but 'turned it around brilliantly.' How do you process this?", o: ["Disqualify — being on a PIP at all indicates fundamental performance gaps that are likely to resurface eventually", "View it positively — the ability to receive critical feedback and improve demonstrates coachability and resilience", "Treat it as neutral information and proceed with standard evaluation without weighting it in either direction", "Report this to the hiring manager as a major concern since PIPs indicate the candidate required extra supervision"], c: 1 },
        { q: "You can't reach any of the candidate's listed references after 3 attempts over a week. What's the correct protocol?", o: ["Proceed with the hire — reference checks are a formality and shouldn't hold up the hiring process timeline", "Ask the candidate for alternative references and explain why this step is non-negotiable in your process", "Treat unreachable references as a red flag and deprioritize this candidate in favor of verifiable alternatives", "Skip references for this candidate and rely on the interview assessment since references are often unreliable"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A reference gives a glowing review but you notice the 'reference' and the candidate are connected on social media as close friends. This affects:", o: ["Nothing — the quality of the feedback matters more than the personal relationship between reference and candidate", "Credibility of the reference — friend references carry inherent bias and should be supplemented with supervisor references", "The reference is still valuable for assessing interpersonal skills but not for evaluating professional performance", "Only the reference's opinion on technical skills is compromised — their assessment of soft skills remains reliable"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Best practice: When should reference checks be conducted in the hiring process?", o: ["Before the first interview — it saves time by eliminating candidates with poor references early in the process", "After final interview, before extending the offer — it validates the decision without wasting references' time prematurely", "After the candidate accepts the offer verbally — conducting checks earlier is premature and wastes resources", "At any convenient point since the timing doesn't significantly impact the quality of information gathered"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A reference says 'I'd rehire them in a heartbeat.' Is this the most valuable reference signal?", o: ["Yes — willingness to rehire is the single most predictive question in reference checking methodology research", "No — follow up with 'In what role?' and 'What would you do differently managing them?' for actionable insight", "Yes — this is the gold-standard response that confirms the candidate's value beyond any other reference metric", "No — enthusiastic references are often favors and shouldn't be weighted heavily compared to neutral assessments"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Legal compliance: What information should you AVOID asking during a reference check?", o: ["Questions about the candidate's specific job performance, including areas of strength and development needs", "Questions about the candidate's health conditions, religion, caste, marital status, or political affiliations", "Questions about whether the candidate was eligible for rehire at their previous organization when they departed", "Questions about the candidate's attendance record and punctuality patterns during their previous employment"], c: 1 },
        { q: "You're checking references for someone who is self-employed for 3 years. Traditional employer references aren't available. What do you verify instead?", o: ["Skip the reference check entirely since self-employed individuals can't provide the standard professional references", "Client references, project portfolios, and professional network endorsements that validate their claimed capabilities", "Request tax returns and business registration documents as proof of self-employment and financial stability", "Only proceed with the hire if they can provide at least one employer reference from before their self-employment period"], c: 1 },
