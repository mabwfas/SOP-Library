        { q: "Accounts Under Management: If you manage 5 Fiverr accounts, a missed health check on ONE account:", o: ["Has no effect on the other accounts", "Can cascade — one account suspension draws Fiverr's attention to ALL linked accounts, risking everything", "Is easily recoverable within 24 hours", "Won't matter if the other 4 accounts are healthy"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Daily Reporting is MANDATORY means:", o: ["Send a report when something goes wrong", "Report EVERY SINGLE DAY even if nothing happened — 'zero incidents' IS a report worth filing", "Weekly summaries are equally acceptable", "Reports are needed when the manager asks for them"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The Risk Manager role differs from a regular Fiverr account manager because:", o: ["They handle more accounts", "Risk Managers are proactive shields — they prevent fires instead of fighting them, anticipating issues before they escalate", "Risk Managers work longer hours", "There is no real difference between the two roles"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A client leaves a threatening message: 'I'll leave 1 star if you don't give me extra revisions.' Your FIRST action:", o: ["Give them the extra revisions to avoid the review", "Document the threat immediately, report to Fiverr Trust & Safety — threatening reviews violates TOS and may get the review removed", "Ignore the threat and hope they forget", "Cancel the order to avoid the negative review"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Account health drops from 100% to 92% in one day. The severity level is:", o: ["Minor — 92% is still a good score", "HIGH ALERT — dropping below 90% triggers Fiverr's review system, you're 2% away from account restrictions", "Moderate — address it within the week", "Not concerning unless it drops below 80%"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Managing multiple accounts requires:", o: ["Checking each account when you have free time", "Systematic daily checks on EVERY account in a fixed order — skipping one day on one account can mean missing a critical deadline", "Focusing on the highest-revenue account first", "Weekly rotation between accounts for efficiency"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A new Risk Manager's biggest mistake in the first month is:", o: ["Being too cautious with client communication", "Underestimating the compounding nature of small issues — a late response + a mediocre delivery + a slow revision = cancelled order", "Not reading the Fiverr TOS thoroughly enough", "Spending too much time on reports instead of work"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The 'shield' metaphor means Risk Managers:", o: ["Block all difficult clients from placing orders", "Stand between the business and account-level threats — absorbing and neutralizing risks before they damage the seller profile", "Shield the team from all client communication", "Prevent all cancellations regardless of circumstances"], c: 1 },
        { q: "If you have zero issues to report today, the correct report is:", o: ["Don't send a report — nothing happened", "'All 5 accounts checked. Zero flags. No pending deadlines within 48hrs. All client communications current.' — zero incidents IS data", "Send an email saying 'All good'", "Wait until something happens worth reporting"], c: 1 }
    ],

    task3Quiz: [
        { q: "The Daily Health Check MUST be performed:", o: ["At the end of the workday", "First thing every morning — catching issues early gives maximum time to resolve them before deadlines hit", "Whenever you remember during the day", "Three times a week minimum"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Per-Account Checklist (7 Items): Missing the 'pending revisions' check can result in:", o: ["A minor delay in delivery", "Auto-cancellation by Fiverr if revision deadline passes — losing the order AND damaging completion rate", "The client requesting a revision later", "No consequence until the client complains"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The order matters in the health check checklist because:", o: ["It looks more professional in reports", "Critical items (expiring orders, pending revisions) checked first means highest-risk issues get attention before lower-priority ones", "Fiverr requires a specific checking order", "All items are equally urgent so order doesn't matter"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Pro Tip: Why should you check the 'buyer's last online' status?", o: ["It's just curiosity about the client", "A buyer offline for 3+ days near a deadline means they may not accept/review delivery — proactive messaging prevents auto-completion delays", "Fiverr tracks whether sellers check buyer activity", "It helps predict future orders from the buyer"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Health check item 'Response Rate': If the Fiverr response rate drops below 90%:", o: ["Nothing happens — response rate is informational", "Gig visibility decreases in Fiverr search — missed messages directly reduce incoming orders", "The account gets a warning email", "Response rate resets monthly anyway"], c: 1 },
        { q: "An order has 6 hours until auto-cancellation. You discover this during the health check. Priority level:", o: ["Handle it after completing the full check", "DROP EVERYTHING — 6 hours is critical, contact the client AND prepare an extension request immediately", "It'll resolve itself when the client responds", "Flag it in the report for the team to handle"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Health check: Order delivered 2 days ago, client hasn't responded. You should:", o: ["Wait for the client to respond — they'll see it eventually", "Send a polite follow-up message asking if the delivery meets expectations — silence near auto-completion can mean they're unhappy", "Mark it as complete in your report", "Cancel the order if the client is unresponsive"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Missing the health check on a Saturday because it's a weekend:", o: ["Is acceptable — weekends are days off", "Is UNACCEPTABLE — Fiverr doesn't stop on weekends, deadlines still run, and Saturday neglect becomes Monday's crisis", "Depends on whether there are active orders", "Is fine if you do a double-check on Monday"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Health check frequency: Why daily instead of every 2-3 days?", o: ["Daily is the company standard but not strictly necessary", "Fiverr situations escalate within hours — a 48-hour gap between checks means issues become emergencies before you see them", "Daily checks are required by Fiverr TOS", "Every 2-3 days works fine for experienced Risk Managers"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Documenting the health check results serves:", o: ["No purpose beyond compliance", "Pattern recognition — repeated issues on the same account reveal systemic problems needing root-cause fixes", "Manager's preference for detailed records", "Legal protection in case of disputes"], c: 1 }
    ],

    task4Quiz: [
        { q: "Daily Reporting must happen EVERY day because:", o: ["The manager wants to know you're working", "Missing data creates blind spots — you can't analyze trends or predict risks from incomplete records", "It's a company policy without practical justification", "Fiverr requires daily reports from sellers"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Report Format — Per Account Breakdown requires splitting by account because:", o: ["It looks more organized", "Problems are account-specific — mixing data across accounts hides which account needs intervention", "Management prefers this format", "Fiverr tracks reports per account"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A GOOD report example includes which critical element that BAD reports miss?", o: ["Word count over 200 words", "Specific numbers and next-action items — 'Account A: 3 active orders, 1 delivery pending review (sent 2 days ago, following up today)'", "Colorful formatting and emojis", "Manager's name in the greeting"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A BAD report says 'Everything is fine across all accounts.' This fails because:", o: ["It's too short to be a real report", "It provides ZERO actionable data — what was checked? How many orders? Any approaching deadlines? 'Fine' is subjective noise", "It doesn't follow the template format", "The tone is too casual for a professional report"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Why include 'upcoming deadlines in next 48 hours' in every report?", o: ["To show you're planning ahead for your manager", "48-hour visibility prevents deadline surprises — if tomorrow's delivery requires client input and the client is offline, you act NOW", "Deadlines further than 48 hours don't need tracking", "It's a formatting requirement, not a practical tool"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Revenue numbers in daily reports help because:", o: ["They make reports longer and more detailed", "Connecting risk management to dollar impact shows which issues threaten the most revenue — a $50 order vs $2000 order need different urgency", "Revenue tracking is the finance team's job", "They impress management during performance reviews"], c: 1 },
        { q: "If you have 5 accounts and 3 had zero issues, your report should:", o: ["Skip the 3 clean accounts to save time", "Include ALL 5 — reporting 'zero issues' for 3 accounts confirms you checked them, silence means you might have skipped them", "Combine the 3 into one line saying 'no issues'", "Ask the manager if zero-issue accounts need reporting"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Late reports (sent at end of day instead of morning) are problematic because:", o: ["They violate the morning reporting policy", "The data arrives too late for action — a deadline approaching at 2 PM needs the morning report to trigger preparation", "Late reports contain stale information", "Management tracks report submission times"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Report escalation flags: When should you add 'URGENT' to a line item?", o: ["When any issue is present in the account", "When an issue requires SAME-DAY action or could result in cancellation/negative review within 24 hours", "When the revenue at risk exceeds $500", "When the client has been unresponsive for over a week"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Consistency in report format across days matters because:", o: ["It satisfies the formatting guidelines", "Consistent structure enables quick comparison between days — changes stand out when the format is familiar", "Reports are archived and need to be uniform", "The reporting tool requires a specific format"], c: 1 }
    ],

    task5Quiz: [
        { q: "The Centralized Google Sheet for feedback tracking serves:", o: ["As a backup for Fiverr's review system", "As the single source of truth — all feedback across all accounts in one place enables pattern detection and trend analysis", "For monthly performance reviews with management", "To share client feedback with the design team"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The 30-Day Rule for feedback means:", o: ["Delete feedback older than 30 days", "Track every piece of feedback from the last 30 days — recent patterns are the strongest predictors of upcoming issues", "Respond to all feedback within 30 days", "Request review removal after 30 days"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Merge All Sheets: Why combine feedback from multiple accounts into one view?", o: ["It reduces the number of spreadsheets to manage", "Cross-account patterns reveal systemic issues — if 3 accounts get 'slow response' complaints, it's a PROCESS problem, not account-specific", "The manager prefers consolidated data", "Google Sheets has a limit on separate files"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A client leaves a 4-star review saying 'Good work but communication could be better.' Your action:", o: ["Be happy with the 4 stars and move on", "Log it, analyze the communication gap, implement fixes — 4 stars on Fiverr is BELOW expectations and affects algorithm ranking", "Thank the client and apologize publicly", "Request Fiverr to boost it to 5 stars"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Tracking private feedback (Fiverr's private review) is important because:", o: ["Private reviews don't affect anything visible", "Fiverr uses private feedback in its algorithm — poor private scores reduce visibility even if public reviews look great", "It's required by the company but not by Fiverr", "Private feedback is shared with the buyer community"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Feedback data showing 'revision requests' spiking in week 3 suggests:", o: ["Clients are becoming more demanding", "Delivery quality may be declining — fatigue, rush jobs, or miscommunication at the briefing stage needs investigation", "It's a random fluctuation with no meaning", "The account is growing and getting pickier clients"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Google Sheet columns should include 'Action Taken' because:", o: ["It fills out the spreadsheet completely", "Tracking responses to feedback creates accountability and a playbook — same issue + same fix = documented SOP", "The manager reviews this column specifically", "Google Sheets templates require this column"], c: 1 },
        { q: "When two accounts receive the same complaint ('files were not organized'), the fix should be:", o: ["Applied to those two accounts specifically", "Applied to ALL accounts — if it happened in two, it'll happen in others, fix the root process universally", "Ignored if it's a minor formatting complaint", "Discussed in the next team meeting for consensus"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Feedback analysis: 5-star reviews that say 'delivered on time' but nothing about quality indicate:", o: ["A perfectly satisfied client", "A potential issue — the client praised speed but NOT quality, which could mean the work was adequate but not impressive", "The client was in a hurry to leave a review", "Great performance since delivery speed is the top priority"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Archiving old feedback (beyond 90 days) should be done:", o: ["By deleting old entries to keep the sheet clean", "By moving to a separate archive tab — historical data is valuable for seasonal patterns and year-over-year comparison", "Immediately after 30 days", "Never — all feedback should remain in the active sheet"], c: 1 }
    ],

    task6Quiz: [
        { q: "When to Send Bonus Messages: Sending a bonus message BEFORE the client has accepted delivery:", o: ["Shows confidence in your work quality", "Is premature — the client hasn't confirmed satisfaction yet, wait until after acceptance and ideally after they've used the work", "Doesn't matter as long as the message is polite", "Is required by the company's review strategy"], c: 1 },
        { q: "When NOT to Send bonus messages:", o: ["After a difficult project where you had disagreements", "When the order was routine and the client seems satisfied", "Both A and C are correct — NEVER send bonus messages after conflict OR to clients who gave signals of being unhappy", "After a revision-heavy order since they might already be annoyed"], c: 2 },
        { q: "Review Follow-Up Protocol: How long after delivery should you wait before following up for a review?", o: ["Immediately after delivery", "3-5 business days — enough time for the client to use the work, but before Fiverr's auto-completion removes urgency", "2 weeks to avoid seeming desperate", "Never follow up — it annoys clients and violates Fiverr TOS"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Even If Zero Messages Sent — REPORT IT. Why?", o: ["To prove you didn't forget about the task", "Zero messages is DATA — it means no orders were at the right stage for bonus messaging, which is important context for analysis", "The report template requires this section", "Management tracks message volume as a KPI"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A client who required 4 revisions finally accepted. Should you send a bonus message?", o: ["Yes — they accepted so they're happy now", "NO — 4 revisions signals frustration, a bonus message feels tone-deaf and risks a negative review they haven't left yet", "Yes, but only after 2 weeks of cooling down", "Send a generic template message to keep it professional"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Bonus message timing on Fiverr matters because:", o: ["Early messages get better response rates", "Fiverr tracks communication patterns — well-timed, genuine messages correlate with higher review rates and scores", "The algorithm rewards frequent communication", "Messages sent during business hours perform better"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The TONE of a bonus message should be:", o: ["Formal and professional: 'We appreciate your business and hope you're satisfied'", "Warm, personal, and specific: 'It was great working on your brand identity! I especially enjoyed the logo concept. Hope it helps your launch!'", "Brief: 'Thanks for the order. Please leave a review.'", "Enthusiastic with lots of emojis and exclamation marks"], c: 1 },
        { q: "If a client's auto-completion triggers without them leaving a review:", o: ["Nothing you can do — move on to the next order", "Send a thoughtful message mentioning the project specifically — some clients don't realize auto-completion happened and will still review", "The opportunity for a review is permanently lost", "File a ticket with Fiverr requesting a review prompt"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Tracking bonus message success rate helps because:", o: ["It's a metric for your performance review", "You identify which message styles and timing produce the most reviews — data-driven refinement of your approach", "Fiverr provides this data automatically in analytics", "Success rates are consistent regardless of message content"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The absolute worst bonus message you can send:", o: ["One that's too long and detailed", "'Please leave a 5-star review' — directly asking for a specific rating feels manipulative and can trigger a spite review", "A message that mentions the project details", "A follow-up message 7 days after delivery"], c: 1 }
    ],

    task7Quiz: [
        { q: "RULE: EVERY Cancellation Gets a Support Ticket because:", o: ["It's a documentation requirement", "Fiverr's system may reverse the cancellation impact on your account if documented properly — filing is damage control", "Support tickets are just for record-keeping", "The rule ensures the team is aware of cancellations"], c: 1 },
        { q: "5-Step Ticket Filing Process: Step 1 is always:", o: ["Contact the client to negotiate", "Take screenshots of EVERYTHING — the order, all messages, delivery files, timeline — evidence before Fiverr's system removes access", "Check the Fiverr Help Center first", "Ask your manager for approval to file"], c: 1 },
        { q: "What to Request in Every Ticket includes asking for:", o: ["A full refund to the client", "Removal of the cancellation's impact on account metrics — Fiverr can exclude certain cancellations from your completion rate", "The client to be banned from Fiverr", "A higher seller level as compensation"], c: 1 },
        { q: "48-Hour Follow-Up Rule: If Fiverr support hasn't responded in 48 hours:", o: ["Wait patiently — support is busy", "Follow up on the ticket with additional context — stale tickets get deprioritized in Fiverr's support queue", "File a new ticket about the same issue", "Accept that the issue won't be resolved"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A cancellation happened because the client ordered the wrong gig. Your ticket should emphasize:", o: ["That the client made a mistake", "That the cancellation was buyer-initiated and not due to seller performance — framing it as a 'buyer error' increases chances of metric removal", "That you delivered the work on time", "That you want the client's account flagged"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Filing tickets for EVERY cancellation even minor ones matters because:", o: ["Volume of tickets shows you're proactive to management", "Each cancellation hits your completion rate — even a 'small' cancellation on a $5 order costs the same percentage as a $5000 one", "Fiverr gives preferential treatment to frequent ticket filers", "Minor cancellations always get automatically resolved"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Evidence collection for the ticket should happen:", o: ["After filing the ticket when support asks for it", "IMMEDIATELY after cancellation — some Fiverr data (messages, order details) may become inaccessible after a period", "Within the same business week", "When you have time to compile everything properly"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Ticket tone should be:", o: ["Aggressive — show Fiverr you're serious", "Professional and factual — 'The buyer ordered the wrong service, all communication proves this. Requesting metric exclusion.'", "Emotional — express how unfair the cancellation was", "Brief — less detail means faster processing"], c: 1 },
        { q: "When Fiverr denies your ticket request, you should:", o: ["Accept the decision and move on", "Escalate politely with additional evidence — initial denials can be overturned when new information or clarification is provided", "File the same ticket again hoping for a different agent", "Threaten to leave the platform if they don't help"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A cancellation that drops your completion rate from 91% to 88% is:", o: ["A minor 3-point drop that will recover naturally", "CRITICAL — below 90% triggers Fiverr's demotion system, every recovered cancellation at this level saves your seller level", "Concerning but not urgent since the threshold is 80%", "Expected fluctuation that happens to all sellers"], c: 1 }
    ],

    task8Quiz: [
        { q: "GOLDEN RULE: NEVER Accept a Client-Initiated Cancellation because:", o: ["Cancellations always hurt the seller equally", "Accepting confirms seller fault in Fiverr's system — even if the buyer wanted to cancel, your acceptance counts against your metrics", "The client might change their mind later", "Fiverr prohibits accepting cancellations"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The 3-Step Cancellation Defense — Step 1 is:", o: ["Offer a full refund immediately to de-escalate", "UNDERSTAND why the client wants to cancel — many cancellation requests stem from fixable issues like miscommunication or unmet expectations", "Tell the client cancellations hurt your account", "Report the client to Fiverr for threatening cancellation"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Client says 'I want to cancel because it's not what I expected.' Your response:", o: ["'I understand, I'll accept the cancellation'", "'I want to make this right.

I'll revise it at no extra cost.'", "'Check the gig description — this is what you ordered'", "'Cancellations are against Fiverr policy'"], c: 1 },
        { q: "When a cancellation IS unavoidable (client genuinely ordered wrong service), the strategy is:", o: ["Accept the cancellation quietly and move on", "Have the CLIENT initiate through Fiverr support, not mutual cancellation — client-initiated support cancellations have less metric impact", "Deliver something anyway so the order isn't technically cancelled", "Ask a colleague to file the cancellation from a different account"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A client demands cancellation because the delivery is 2 hours late. Your defense:", o: ["Accept — lateness is your fault", "Apologize sincerely, deliver IMMEDIATELY with a small bonus (extra concept/revision), and request they review the work before deciding", "Argue that 2 hours is within reasonable flexibility", "Blame technical issues for the delay"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The cancellation defense 'offer alternatives' works by:", o: ["Giving the client more options to complain about", "Reframing cancellation as unnecessary — 'instead of cancelling, I can do X revision or Y modification' makes saving the order easier than cancelling", "Stalling until the client gives up on cancelling", "Making the cancellation process more complicated for the client"], c: 1 },
        { q: "After successfully preventing a cancellation through revision:", o: ["Move on to the next order — crisis averted", "Follow up after delivery to ensure full satisfaction — a saved cancellation can still turn into a negative review if the fix wasn't enough", "Send a bonus message requesting a 5-star review", "Report the client as difficult for future reference"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Client drops the cancellation request and says 'fine, finish it.' Your delivery should:", o: ["Be exactly what was originally agreed — nothing more", "EXCEED expectations — over-deliver on a saved cancellation to flip the narrative from 'I almost cancelled' to 'I'm glad I didn't'", "Be rushed out before they change their mind", "Include a note reminding them not to leave a bad review"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Cancellation defense data: Tracking which defenses worked and which didn't helps:", o: ["Build a case for management that you're trying", "Create a playbook — knowing that 'offer revision' saves 70% of cancellations but 'offer discount' saves 40% informs future strategy", "Nothing practical since each situation is unique", "Meet the monthly saved-cancellation KPI target"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A returning client requests cancellation on their 5th order. This is:", o: ["Normal — even loyal clients sometimes cancel", "A RED FLAG — investigate what changed, this could signal declining quality, changed needs, or a relationship problem that affects future orders", "Expected since clients try to test boundaries over time", "Not concerning since their 4 previous orders were successful"], c: 1 }

This helps me deliver exactly what you need.'", "'Send me all the details and I'll review them'", "'Check my gig description for what I offer'"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Response time under 1 hour matters on Fiverr because:", o: ["It's a polite business practice", "Fiverr's algorithm rewards fast responders with higher search ranking AND buyers often message multiple sellers — first response wins", "Fiverr publicly displays response time on gig pages", "Buyers are impatient and will cancel if you're slow"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Handling a brief that's outside your gig scope:", o: ["Accept it anyway to maintain revenue", "Politely decline AND redirect: 'This isn't my specialty, but I'd recommend [specific alternative] for the best result.

        { q: "A client sends a brief with 15 requirements. Your response should:", o: ["Quote a price for all 15 items immediately", "Organize their requirements, confirm understanding, flag any conflicts, suggest phasing — show you read every line and can manage complexity", "Tell them to reduce the scope to something manageable", "Accept everything and figure it out during delivery"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Brief response on Fiverr differs from email communication because:", o: ["The same rules apply across all platforms", "Fiverr buyers are in 'buying mode' — your response must confirm capability AND move toward an order, not start a lengthy email thread", "Fiverr messages should be shorter than emails", "Email allows attachments but Fiverr doesn't"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Upselling in the brief response stage: 'I noticed you mentioned needing X. I also offer Y which would complement it.' This works because:", o: ["It increases the order value immediately", "It demonstrates expertise beyond the initial request — the client sees you understand their broader needs, building trust", "Upselling should never happen before the first order", "Clients expect sellers to push additional services"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A client asks for a discount before placing their first order:", o: ["Always give first-order discounts to win the client", "Justify your pricing with value: 'My pricing reflects [specific value/experience/results]. Many clients find the quality saves them from costly revisions elsewhere.'", "Refuse all discounts on principle", "Offer 50% off to secure the order"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The worst brief response mistake is:", o: ["Taking more than 30 minutes to respond", "Sending a generic copy-paste response that doesn't address anything specific from their message — it screams 'I didn't read your brief'", "Writing too long of a response", "Asking too many questions before quoting"], c: 1 },
        { q: "After a successful brief response, the client goes silent for 3 days. You should:", o: ["Move on — they're not interested", "Send ONE follow-up: 'Hi [name], just checking in on the project we discussed. Happy to answer any other questions!' — gentle nudge without pressure", "Send daily follow-ups until they respond", "Report the conversation as possibly lost in your daily report"], c: 1 }

        { q: "Identifying delivery risk BEFORE starting work helps because:", o: ["It delays the project unnecessarily", "Preemptive risk identification prevents surprises — flagging a tight deadline or unclear brief on day 1 is better than discovering it on day 5", "Risk assessment is the PM's job, not the Risk Manager's", "Delivery risks rarely materialize if the team is skilled"], c: 1 },
        { q: "A design order with a 3-day deadline and no brand guidelines provided. The delivery risk is:", o: ["Low — 3 days is enough for a design", "HIGH — no brand guidelines means revision risk, the client may reject work that doesn't match their unspoken expectations", "Medium — most clients are flexible about brand consistency", "Zero — designers can create brand guidelines from scratch"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Mitigating delivery risk: 'Setting expectations upfront' means:", o: ["Telling clients you might be late", "Confirming deliverables, timeline, revision count, and quality standards BEFORE starting — misaligned expectations cause 80% of disputes", "Sending the Fiverr gig description to the client", "Asking the client to lower their expectations"], c: 1 },

        { q: "Delivery risk escalation: When should you escalate to management?", o: ["After the delivery is already late", "When you identify a risk you CANNOT mitigate alone — client unresponsive, team member sick, technical blocker with no workaround", "When the client asks for a revision", "At the end of the week during the weekly report"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Quality assurance before delivery reduces risk by:", o: ["Making the team do double work", "Catching issues before the client sees them — internal QA prevents revision rounds that eat into deadline buffer", "Adding unnecessary steps to the workflow", "Guaranteeing the client will accept on first delivery"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Client timezone difference is a delivery risk because:", o: ["It makes scheduling calls difficult", "A client 12 hours away means your 'urgent message' sits unread for 12 hours — timezone math must factor into deadline planning", "Timezones don't affect digital deliveries", "Fiverr adjusts deadlines for timezone differences automatically"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Buffer time in delivery scheduling means:", o: ["Padding the quote with extra days for laziness", "Building in 20-30% extra time for unexpected issues — a 5-day project should be internally targeted for 3.5-4 days", "Delivering early to impress the client", "The time between delivery and the client's review"], c: 1 },

        { q: "Assessment scenario: Account A has a cancellation request, Account B has a delivery due in 4 hours, Account C has a negative review. Priority order:", o: ["A → B → C (cancellation first)", "B → A → C — the 4-hour deadline is the MOST time-sensitive, then the cancellation defense, then the review response", "C → A → B (review damage control first)", "Handle them in the order you discovered them"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Multi-account crisis: Two accounts get cancellation requests simultaneously. You should:", o: ["Handle the higher-revenue order first", "Assess BOTH immediately — determine which has a tighter deadline and higher metric impact, then deploy defenses in priority order", "Ask management which to prioritize", "Send template responses to both while you figure out the strategy"], c: 1 },

        { q: "Risk Manager KPI: What metric matters most for your performance?", o: ["Number of daily reports filed on time", "Account health maintenance score — keeping all accounts above safety thresholds through proactive intervention", "Number of issues identified per week", "Client satisfaction ratings across accounts"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The interconnected nature of Risk Management skills means:", o: ["Each module can be applied independently", "Health checks feed reports, reports reveal patterns, patterns guide prevention, prevention reduces cancellations — they form a continuous improvement cycle", "Learning the modules in order is important for the exam", "Some skills are more important than others"], c: 1 },
        { q: "After certification, a Risk Manager should:", o: ["Stop training since certification covers everything", "Continue refining through real-world experience — the training provides the framework, but mastery comes from applying it daily under real pressure", "Mentor new Risk Managers as their primary role", "Focus exclusively on the highest-revenue accounts"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Crisis communication SOP requires responding to clients within:", o: ["24 hours is the standard SLA", "1 hour maximum during a crisis — silence breeds anxiety, and anxious clients escalate to cancellations", "30 minutes is ideal but 4 hours is acceptable", "The same day is fast enough for most situations"], c: 1 },

        { q: "Scenario: You just prevented a cancellation, saved a 4-star review by getting it changed to 5-star, and filed a successful support ticket. Report this as:", o: ["A normal successful day", "Detailed data: 'Account B: Cancellation defense successful (revision method). Review upgraded 4→5 (follow-up protocol). Completion rate ticket accepted — metric restored.' — specifics enable replication", "A brief note: 'Good day, all issues handled'", "Three separate reports for each event"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The biggest Risk Manager failure mode is:", o: ["Missing one daily report", "Becoming reactive instead of proactive — waiting for fires instead of checking smoke detectors daily", "Not having enough Fiverr platform knowledge", "Filing tickets that get denied by Fiverr support"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Daily Health Check (Task 3) + Daily Reporting (Task 4) together create:", o: ["Redundant documentation overhead", "A complete monitoring system — health checks are the input, reports are the output, together they create an audit trail and early warning system", "Extra work that could be consolidated into one task", "A system that works for any freelance platform"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Feedback Tracker (Task 5) + Bonus Messages (Task 6) together optimize:", o: ["The number of messages sent per day", "The quality of reviews — tracking reveals what causes good/bad reviews, bonus messaging capitalizes on positive moments to boost ratings", "Client communication frequency", "Report length and detail level"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Cancelled Orders (Task 7) + Cancellation Strategy (Task 8) together form:", o: ["A complete guide to accepting cancellations properly", "A defense-and-recovery system — prevention first (strategy), then damage control when prevention fails (ticket filing)", "The most important section of the training", "Skills that are rarely needed in practice"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Brief Response (Task 9) + Delivery Risk (Task 10) together:", o: ["Cover the beginning and end of an order", "Create an end-to-end risk framework — brief response catches risks at inquiry stage, delivery risk management catches them during execution", "Are the easiest modules in the training", "Deal with client communication exclusively"], c: 1 },
        { q: "What separates a certified Risk Manager from someone who just manages Fiverr accounts?", o: ["The certification badge on their profile", "SYSTEMATIZED thinking — certified managers have frameworks for every scenario, not ad-hoc reactions to each problem", "Years of experience on the platform", "Access to advanced Fiverr seller tools"], c: 1 },
        { q: "The Risk Manager's impact on business revenue is:", o: ["Indirect — they support the delivery team", "Direct and measurable — every saved cancellation, every upgraded review, every prevented demotion translates to protected and grown revenue", "Minimal compared to the sales team's contribution", "Difficult to quantify in financial terms"], c: 1 },
        { q: "Your first day after certification should include:", o: ["Celebrating and taking it easy", "Implementing your daily system: morning health check, report by 10 AM, feedback tracker update, risk scan — the framework works from day one", "Re-reading the training manual", "Requesting access to additional accounts immediately"], c: 1 }
